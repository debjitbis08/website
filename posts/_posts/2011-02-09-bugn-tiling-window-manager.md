title: bug.n - tiling window manager
---

Recently I have been interested in tiling window managers. I have fallen in love with the concept and have been trying to use it for my daily activities. For those of you who do not know what a tiling widow manager, here is a small definition from wikipedia:

> is a window manager with an organization of the screen into mutually non-overlapping frames

For more details it is best you read the Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager" target="_blank">entry</a> and then try one.

It's been over a month now that I am using <a href="http://wmii.suckless.org/" target="_blank">wmii</a> window manager for Linux on my PC, but I didn't expect to find one for MS Windows, which I have to regrettably use in my office. It is then that I finally Googled :) and the found <a href="http://www.autohotkey.net./~joten/" target="_blank">bug.n</a>. It is **"A tiling window manager add-on for Microsoft Windows"**.

Personally I like the concept of minimal mouse usage, automatic window arrangement, maximum use of screen estate, tags (kind-of workspace, but much more flexible), and not to mention the geeky feel :P

The only way one can understand the advantages and feel of a tiling window manager is by using one. bug.n does not need to be installed. Just <a href="http://www.autohotkey.net./~joten/download/bugn_810.zip" target="_blank">download</a>[Update: <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12477" target="_blank">Download Page</a>] the package, unzip the contents and run the bugn.exe file. It is highly configurable and if you are ready to get your hands dirty you can even modify the source, quite easily.

Below is a screenshot of my desktop. The screenshot does not convey much information about bug.n, but still for those who can't do without one.
