title: Tata Aircel collaborate for 3G (proof)
---
There has been some news about <a href="http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=202824" target="_blank">Tata and Aircel joining hands</a> to deliver 3G networks, but I have been unable to find any proof or statement regarding this.

Well, all this changed today, when I observed the operator string on my phone saying "TATA DOCOMO AIRCEL". Also the network was fluctuating between 3G and 3.5G(!!!!). Fortunately I was able to get a screenshot to record this strange behaviour. Was this a test, a technical glitch or a supernatural event? I have no idea.

Another  interesting point is that Aircel does not yet have a 3G network in Pune (where I recorded this). Does this mean Aircel is launching 3G in Maharashtra soon? You can speculate as much as you want.
