title: First contribution to IMDb
---
<p>I just made my first contribution to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">IMDb</a> by adding the plot outline for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926084/"  target="_blank">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a>. I like this not because I contributed to IMDb but because it was something related to Harry Potter series. After all, I have spent months pouring over the books, ignoring many other important things.</p>
<p>
Well, here is the plot outline I submitted that is currently on display.
<blockquote>
As Harry races against time and evil to destroy the Horcruxes, he uncovers the existence of three most powerful objects in the wizarding world: the Deathly Hallows. </blockquote></p>
