<p>If you planning to buy a 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.klipsch.com/na-en/products/image-s2m-in-ear-headset-with-mic-overview/">Klipsch S2m</a>
    headset to use with your N900, my suggestion is don&#39;t buy them because they don&#39;t work.</p>
<p>For all others who already have bought one, here is my solution to get them to work with 
    your N900. </p>
    
<h5>Hardware solution</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Plug in your earbuds. You will hear a strange 
    buzzing noise.</li>
    <li>Now very carefully pull them out, not completely only till the 
    noise stops.</li>
    <li>Play a song and try to adjust the jack so that the song sounds 
    as it should.</li>
    <li>The mic will work too. </li>
    </ol>
<h5>Software solution</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Plug in your earbuds.</li>
    <li>Type <code>alsamixer -c0</code> in the terminal.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the <b>Jack Function</b> control. The value will be TV-Out.</li>
    <li>Change it to <b>Headset</b> with the arrow keys.</li>
    <li>Go to the <b>Left DAC Mux</b> control, just to the left of the Jack Function control.</li>
    <li>Change the value to <b>DAC_L3</b>.</li>
    </ol>
<p>Well as you see both the solution are a pain. But don&#39;t get me wrong, the earphones are great. Great sound quality and 
    very comfortable. If you have an Apple device, the earphones will work fine. I 
    have tested them with the iPhone.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
