title: Indicom ends unlimited T2T STD offer
---
<p>
Tata Indicom has <em>effectively</em> discontinued its unlimited T2T STD offer by introducing a usage limit for STD calls. The number of minutes has now been limited to <strong>3000 minutes</strong>. After this limit is crossed the STD rates will be 20p/min to Tata numbers and 50p/min to others networks. Customer Care representatives have confirmed this for Maharashtra and Kolkata circles, but I am not sure about other circles. It is advisable that you confirm with Customer Care regarding this special recharge.
</p>
<p>
Tata Indicom used to offer this without any cap on usage limits but it seems that days of unlimited calling are now over. This modified tariff is activated on recharging with Rs. 599/- (Maharashtra), Rs. 699/- (Kolkata), Rs. 499/- (Jharkhand) etc. Below is the complete list of various circles and the correspondings recharge rates required to avail this plan. Please refer the Tata Indicom website for further information.
