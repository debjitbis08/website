title: First experience as LUG instructor
---
<p>
Today the second interactive session for BIT LUG was held. I was one of the 'instructors' (first time). There were four people on the organizing side. As our exams are just a few days away there were not many students present.
</p>
<p>
We discussed some basic commands as most students using Linux for the first time are scared of the terminal. We have local repository for Ubuntu, so we discussed some ubuntu/debian related commands like apt-get and apt-cache
</p>
<p>

Most of the students were using Linux for the first time, so i had to keep the discussion simple. Only one person had used the cp command out of about 16. The person organizing the session informed me just a few hours earlier that i have to discuss about terminal commands, so i quickly prepared some notes from the book Shell Programming by Yashwant Kanetkar :).
</p>
<p>
The topics discussed were :
<ul>
<li>Linux directory structure</li>
<li>moving files</li>
<li>renaming files</li>
<li>removing directories</li>
<li>find and grep</li>
<li>searching and installing packages</li>
<li>man command</li>
<li>network setup (using gui)</li>
<li>sudo command</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I did forget the command for adding a user to a particular group (gpasswd), which someone asked, but i was able to suggest an alternate way, which is by editing the /etc/group file (which is what i usually do). While explaining the directory structure i was asked, how is this structure better than the one used by windows; i was not able to answer this clearly.There were some questions about wine and running windows programs. There were many other important commands which i wanted to discuss like passwd, date, tar etc. but we didn't have time, well we will continue in the next session.

It was a great experience. Hope i was able to share whatever little knowledge i have.
